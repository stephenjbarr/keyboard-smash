Baby Flip
=========

Goal: Create some fun browser-based games for Jeffrey Arthur Barr! Use
JavaScript and three.js to create some simple 3D, perhaps adding in
some physics later on.

------------------

* Time to get started. Create directory and index.html. Download
  minified three.js from
  http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/build/three.min.js

* Got a bunch of stuff working!

------------------

* Try (and fail) to generalize the image loading. I don't understand
  enough about JavaScript closures to do this.

* Evening, clone Stephen's github repo, add my files, init my local
  repo, and commit.
